# Tips for International Students

## Should I get a SIM card? 
We highly recommend that you get one. Getting US SIM card is important for getting mobile data that you will most likely need to use for navigation. You'll need it to open a bank account, as many banks require a phone number. Also, having a SIM card is necessary to create an account for the Deneve laundry app, wash-connect. 

## Should I open a US bank account?
We suggest that you open an account as soon as possible. Opening a bank account can help you receive your stipend more easily and exchange money with other people using Zelle. You can open a Chase bank account without a Social Security number. There's a [Chase bank in Westwood](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mhbKvpndaGWy8GZb8) that you can walk to. 

## Why should I get a credit/debit card?
We strongly encourage you to have a credit/debit card as many places do not accept cash. Alternatively, you can also bring cash and pay people who have a card. We also used services like Apple Cash and Venmo to pay people back.
