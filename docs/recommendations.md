## What did you do on the weekends?
These are some activities in LA that we enjoyed on the weekends:

### The Hammer Museum. 
Located in Westwood, walking distance from UCLA, the museum is open on Thursday evenings for free summer concerts.

### The Getty Museum and Getty Villa. 
Two really cool museums. The Getty Villa is centered on ancient Greek and Roman artifacts and the Getty has a variety of art from many different time periods. Both are free, but note that you need to make a reservation for a time slot in advance. 

### Will Rogers State Park. 
Accessible by bus, has a short 2 mile loop with a connecting trail where you can go on for many miles.

### Santa Monica Beach. 
This beach is the closest to IPAM, only 30 minutes away by bus. 

### The Hollywood Bowl. 
This is an outdoor concert venue that you might want to check out for cool events throughout the summer. 

### Downtown. 
Downtown is a great place to take a day trip and explore. Some attractions are the Walt Disney concert hall, Grand Central Market, and the Broad.
