# Recommendations


## What did you do on the weekends?

These are some activities in LA that we enjoyed on the weekends:
- **The Hammer Museum**:Located in Westwood (walking distance from UCLA). The museum is open on Thursday evenings for free summer concerts.
- **The Getty Museum and Getty Villa**: Two really cool museums. The Getty Villa is centered on ancient Greek and Roman artifacts and the Getty has a variety of art from many different time periods. Both are free, but note that you need to make a reservation for a time slot in advance. 
- **Will Rogers State Park**: Accessible by bus, has a short 2 mile loop with a connecting trail where you can go on for many miles.
- **Santa Monica Beach**: This beach is the closest to IPAM, only 30 minutes away by bus. 
- **The Hollywood Bowl**: This is an outdoor concert venue that you might want to check out for cool events throughout the summer. 
- **Downtown**: Downtown is a great place to take a day trip and explore. Some attractions are the Walt Disney concert hall, Grand Central Market, and the Broad.
