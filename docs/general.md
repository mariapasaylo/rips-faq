# General FAQ


## Where's the nearest urgent/immediate care?
- [UCLA Health Westwood Immediate care](https://www.uclahealth.org/locations/westwood-immediate-care). Call them before you go.


## Which gyms/workout areas do we have access to? 
- [Bruin Fitness Center (BFIT)](https://recreation.ucla.edu/bfit)
If you just want a quick workout, this is the go-to gym. It is near De Neve housing. 
- [John Wooden Center](https://recreation.ucla.edu/jwc)
They almost have everything that you can think of. We often went here for open rec sports, and the front desk usually has some equipment available to lend. Note: We left badminton rackets :badminton: at IPAM. If they are no longer there, we recommend going to Big 5 Sporting Goods.
- [UCLA Intramural Fields](https://recreation.ucla.edu/facilities/intramural-field)
This is where we often played football :soccer: . Note: If you need ice packs, ask the front desk of JWC/BFIT. We often had some minor injuries.
- [Sunset Canyon Recreation Center](https://recreation.ucla.edu/scrc)
They have pools and beach volleyball.
